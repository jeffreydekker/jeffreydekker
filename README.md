  Hi there 👋🏻 I love programming, cars, gaming, gym, drawing and making music, but I'm currently going all-in 
  with development.
  I'm a "self taught" full-stack web developer with 2+ years of experience. I have done many free courses through freeCodeCamp and other sources, and I've invested in several bootcamps over the last 2 years. One of those is Bit-Academy, where I've learned full-stack development. I was also a part of the life changing Codam Piscine. I'm commited to contribute a lot of impactful projects to Github for 2023.

  Some more info about me:
  - 💻 My workstation: Macbook Pro 2018 15" 32GB RAM 2,2GHz i7 Ventura 13.1
  - 🔭 I’m currently working on profile based database website functionality
  - 🌱 I’m currently learning PHP in conjunction with AJAX
  - 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on websites and databases
